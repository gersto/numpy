## Broadcasting

When we add a scalar to a 1-d array like this, the scalar gets added to each element of the array. 
```python
np.array([1,2,3]) + 0.5
# [1.5, 2.5, 3.5]
```

In essence, numpy is expanding the scalar into 3-element array and then does element-wise addition between the arrays. (NumPy doesn't actually do this because it'd be horribly inneficient, but in essence that's what's happening.) This is an example of [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html).

Broadcasting Rules (suppose we want to add two arrays, A and B ...):
- Moving backwards from the last dimension of each array, we check if their dimensions are compatible
- Dimensions are compatible if they are equal or either of them is one.
- If all of A's dimensions are compatible with B's dimensions, or vice versa, they are compatible arrays.

### Compatibility

Not every pair of arrays are compatible for broadcasting. Suppose we want to add two arrays, A and B..
- Moving backwards from the last dimension of each array,
  - We check if their dimensions are "compatible". Dimensions are compatible if they are equal or either of them is 1
  - If all of A's dimensions are compatible with B's dimensions, or vice versa, they are compatible arrays

### Examples

#### Example1

![broadcast07](pictures/numpy11_07.jpg)

We start by comparing the last dimension of each array

![broadcast08](pictures/numpy11_08.jpg)

Numpy can expand B

![broadcast09](pictures/numpy11_09.jpg)

Then we have to compare the first dimension. Since they are equal they are compatible

```python
np.random.seed(1234)
A = np.random.randint(low = 1, high = 10, size = (3, 4))
B = np.random.randint(low = 1, high = 10, size = (3, 1))

print(A)
# [[4 7 6 5]
#  [9 2 8 7]
#  [9 1 6 1]]

print(B)
# [[7]
#  [3]
#  [1]]
```

A + B = ???

```python
A.shape  # (3, 4)
B.shape  # (3, 1)
##          ^  ^
##         compatible
```
Here, A is a 3x4 array and B is a 3x1 array. We start by comparing the last dimension of each array.
- Since the last dimension of A is length 4 and the last dimension of B is length 1, numpy can expand B by making 4 copies of it along its second axis. So, these dimensions are compatible.
- Now we have to compare the first dimension of A and B. Since they're both length 3, theyâ€™re compatible.

The only thing left for numpy is to carry out whatever procedure we wanted on two equivalently sized 3x4 arrays. (Remember, NumPy doesn't actually expand B like this because it'd be horribly inneficient.)

#### Example2

![broadcast10](pictures/numpy11_10.jpg)

![broadcast11](pictures/numpy11_11.jpg)

![broadcast11](pictures/numpy11_12.jpg)

```python
np.random.seed(4321)
A = np.random.randint(low = 1, high = 10, size = (4, 4))
B = np.random.randint(low = 1, high = 10, size = (2, 1))

print(A)
# [[3 9 3 2]
#  [8 6 3 5]
#  [7 1 9 7]
#  [6 4 2 2]]

print(B)
# [[7]
#  [2]]
```

A + B = ???

```python
A.shape  # (4, 4)
B.shape  # (2, 1)
##          ^  ^
##         not compatible
```

Here, A is a 4x4 array and B is a 2x1 array.
- The last dimension of A is length 4 and the last dimension of B is length 1, so these dimensions are compatible. We can temporarily transform B by making 4 copies of it along its 2nd axis.
- Now we compare the 1st dimension of each array. In this case, there isn't an obvious way to expand B into a 4x4 array to match A or vice versa, so **these arrays are not compatible**.

#### Example3

![broadcast13](pictures/numpy11_13.jpg)

![broadcast14](pictures/numpy11_14.jpg)

![broadcast15](pictures/numpy11_15.jpg)

![broadcast16](pictures/numpy11_16.jpg)

```python
np.random.seed(1111)
A = np.random.randint(low = 1, high = 10, size = (3, 1, 4))
B = np.random.randint(low = 1, high = 10, size = (2, 1))

print(A)
# [[[8 6 2 3]]
#  [[5 9 7 5]]
#  [[9 7 3 7]]]

print(B)
# [[9]
#  [4]]
```

A + B = ???

```python
A.shape  # (3, 1, 4)
B.shape  # (   2, 1)
#           ^  ^  ^
#         compatible
```

Here, A is a 3x1x4 array and B is a 2x1 array.
- We start by comparing the last dimension of each array. In this case, A is length 4 and B is length 1, so we can expand B into a 2x4 array, making these dimensions compatible.
- Next, we compare the 2nd to last dimension of each array. In this case, A is length 1 and B is length 2. This time, we expand A, copying it twice along its second axis to match B.
- At this point, we're out of B dimensions, so we know A and B are compatible. To complete our mental model of how math between these arrays would work, we can imagine copying B 3 times along a newly added first dimension.
- We're left with two transformed arrays, each with shape 3x2x4, which we can easily add.
