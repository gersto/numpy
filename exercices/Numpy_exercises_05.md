#### 82. Compute a matrix rank

#### 83. How to find the most frequent value in an array?

#### 84. Extract all the contiguous 3x3 blocks from a random 10x10 matrix

#### 85. Create a 2D array subclass such that Z[i,j] == Z[j,i]

#### 86. Consider a set of p matrices with shape (n,n) and a set of p vectors with shape (n,1). How to compute the sum of of the p matrix products at once? (result has shape (n,1))

#### 89. How to get the n largest values of an array

#### 90. Given an arbitrary number of vectors, build the cartesian product (every combinations of every item)

#### 91. How to create a record array from a regular array?

#### 92. Consider a large vector Z, compute Z to the power of 3 using 3 different methods

#### 93. Consider two arrays A and B of shape (8,3) and (2,2). How to find rows of A that contain elements of each row of B regardless of the order of the elements in B?

#### 94. Considering a 10x3 matrix, extract rows with unequal values (e.g. [2,2,3])

#### 95. Convert a vector of ints into a matrix binary representation

#### 96. Given a two dimensional array, how to extract unique rows?

#### 97. Considering 2 vectors A & B, write the einsum equivalent of inner, outer, sum, and mul function

#### 98. Considering a path described by two vectors (X,Y), how to sample it using equidistant samples

#### 99. Given an integer n and a 2D array X, select from X the rows which can be interpreted as draws from a multinomial distribution with n degrees, i.e., the rows which only contain integers and which sum to n.

#### 100. Compute bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the mean of a 1D array X (i.e., resample the elements of an array with replacement N times, compute the mean of each sample, and then compute percentiles over the means).
